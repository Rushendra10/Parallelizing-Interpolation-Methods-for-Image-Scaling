# Parallelizing-Interpolation-Methods-for-Image-Scaling

This project explores the performance of image scaling using interpolation methods by implementing both serial and parallelized versions. Two interpolation techniques—**linear interpolation** and **nearest neighbor interpolation**—were used to compare performance in scaling images.

## Overview
- **Interpolation Methods**: Implemented linear interpolation and nearest neighbor interpolation.
- **Parallelization**: Developed both serial and parallel versions to evaluate efficiency and speed improvements.
- **Performance Comparison**: Benchmarked both methods to analyze how parallelization impacts scaling performance.

This project was used to compare the performance of different parallel computing platforms in optimizing image processing algorithms.
